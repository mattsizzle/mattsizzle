- 👋 Hi, I’m @mattsizzle
- 👀 I’m currently interested in a whole lot of stuff or maybe a shinny new thing, my attention wanders like a dog let free in the park.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Go](https://golang.org/) and a miscellany of things from containerization to home automation to woodworking and electrical engineering.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on just about anything really. I like squashing bugs and jumping into random codebases.
- 📫 For inquiries feel free to reach out to me at [matt@mattgreen.dev](mailTo:matt@mattgreen.dev)
